The urge for a change in the power systems.
The dominance of AC networks since the mid 19th century to power lighting and industrial motors was due to the flexibility of AC power to transform to different voltage levels and transmit it over long distances. However, challanges such as high energy costs, limited fund to expand the grid and construct new power plants are some of the constraints to meet the growing energy demands. Moreover, the global warming, aging of the current power system infrastructures, increased awareness of limited energy generation resouces, higher energy consumption standards and the increased number of DC loads due to the advance of power electronics reveal that modernization of the current energy system is inevitable.

Consequently, the MG provides an opportunity to optimize the utilization of renewable energy resources with improved overall thermal and electrical efficiencies by properly locating different DG units while considering their geographical conditions and the nature of available loads [43]. Such operating conditions require the microgrid systems to have wide-range control systems in order to perform large number of tasks.

Distributed generation (DG) units as referred to small generators or decentralized generations can either be used as stand-alone
systems at an isolated area (e.g. rural areas) or utility-connected
systems [57–59]. When used as stand-alone systems, the DG units
are usually operated by individuals to serve small houses such as
single households to large buildings e.g. housing estate or suburb
locality, an academic or public community, an industrial site or
municipal region [60,61]. Larger capacity DG units are managed by
the utility or an independent power producer (IPP). The utilities
use DG units to help them to improve power supply flexibility,
quality and expandability, system stability, optimize distribution
system and reduce transmission and distribution cost.  In most
cases, the DG units produce incompatible AC power or DC power
as a result the desired voltage magnitude, frequency and phase
angle are usually obtained through the use of power electronics
interfaces [62–64]. Each DG unit can be connected to the main grid
by using the appropriate power electronics interface. However,
using a single power electronics interface for all DG units leads
to advantages of reduced losses, easier design and control with
reduced cost [65,66].

So far, the DG units based on RESs are generally more sustainable (i.e. their energy sources will not perish in the long run) with
little or no environmental damage than their counterparts. Solar
PV arrays [37,66], geothermal and wind [25,26], tidal waves
[28,31], low-head (small) hydro, biomass and biogas [38] together
with hydrogen fuel cells [42] (hydrogen extracted using renewable
sources) are examples of RES based DG units. These DG units can
be aggregated to provide DC input voltage for the DC/AC inverter
for grid-connection or strategically connected to the low voltage
distribution systems (i.e. LVAC or LVDC networks) depending on
their power output to form microgrid structures [67,68]. Alternatively, the microgrid concept enables high penetration of various
DG units and ESSs without the need of restructuring the distribution system itself. 

In a broader and futuristic manner, microgrids (MGs) are tiny
power systems which embed various components such as controlled and uncontrolled loads, DG units and storage devices
operating together in a coordinated manner with controlled power
electronic devices (active and reactive power flow controllers,
frequency and voltage regulators) which are integrated with
protective devices. They can be operated with the principles of the AC power systems or the DC. These functionalities are similar to the concept of a smart grid, where it is thought that the microgrids are accounted as parts of a huge componentized system that can be seem by:
- The utility as controllable entities that operates as a single dispatched unit (load or generator) to provide power, ancillary services, and meet the needs of upstream networks.
- The customers as a provider of thermal and electricity needs to meet special demands such as local reliability, and can improve power quality.

DG units and ESSs can be aggregated and be used as the “virtual power plant(VPP)” main building blocks [1,82]. In contrast with the MGs, the VPPs are the new concepts which consist of aggregated DG units that are treated as a single entity. Typically, the individual resources would be small but pooled together to form a size which can provide reactive power or support peak power demand.
