The DC microgrids can be used for remote area electrification of countrysides.

The paper proposes a two-stage supervisory energy management system for optimal 
operation of PV/Wind/Tidal microgrid with one-time communication to avoid 
excessive use of communication bandwidth in real-time.

MGs suffer from control and coordination problems originated from 
inter-temporal operation of ESSs and intermittent nature of RESs. In this 
regard, an energy management system (EMS) is required to mitigate these 
issues and optimizing the MG energy management operation over long duration.

MG energy management system performs optimal scheduling of MG system against 
defined objectives in the domains of economics, environment, and reliability
 among others. EMS is the tertiary layer of MG control and in hierarchy it
operates above the control and power management levels, i.e above
primary and secondary layers respectively.

Control level ensures voltage and current regulation, while power management
 level deals with harmonic compensation, line limits, and voltage and frequency
restoration. Therefore, EMS layer ensures operational efficiency while also 
governing lower layers of control to satisfy the system stability and 
performance requirements.

The author describes optimal, sub-optimal and not optimal methods of EMS.

Critiques of previous works:
- The practical battery degradation cost model is ignored;
- have not considered the **optimal** scheduling taking into account the 
battery lifetime degradation. 
- Load shedding and battery cyclelife limitations.
- EMS strategy for low generation periods is not considered.

Pros for the paper:
- considers EMS with optimal resource scheduling;
- battery degradation cost.
- Mathematical formulation of EMS is generic in nature and can be applied to 
other MG as well.

Roles of EMS:
- An EMS is used for supervisory control of DC MG;
- EMS performs the operation of data collection, where it stores the data of 
load demand, resource availability, etc. EMS collects and stores
data from energy sources and load to perform future forecasting and
system analysis. Determines day-ahead optimal decision strategies.
- EMS also performs scheduling operation in two stages (optimization and 
adjustment), where it efficiently determines a dayahead schedule of all 
energy sources. 
- EMS acts as a coordinator for information exchange to local controller. All 
local controllers of RESs operate in either MPPT or power curtailment modes.

Two stages EMS:
- Optimizations:
Forecasted generation and load profiles, operating costs and
penalty data, DERs operational limits, and DC MG system data are sent
to the optimization model for determining decision strategies. These
scheduled strategies are then sent to the adjustment stage.

Modeled with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)

- adjustments.
The adjusted day-ahead scheduled strategies are then sent to the adjustment 
stage. The adjusted day-ahead scheduled decisions are forwarded to local 
controllers.

The centralized EMS, in addition to high utilization of communication 
bandwidth, faces security threat due to constant data and information sharing 
with the central controller. In this regard, a modified communication 
strategy is proposed for information sharing among local controllers and EMS.
Once the EMS performs otpimization, the modified decisions are communicated
to other participants **only once** to maximally avoid security threats and use
minimum communication bandwidth in real-time.

The adjustments of scheduling decisions of the EMS optimization model
are based on the mismatching of the power generation and demand:
- Demand + losses > scheduled generation: EMS sends optmal decisions to local
controllers of RES.
- Demand + losses < scheduled generation: Operation in power limitation mode.

all RESs either generate maximum power or curtail power generation as decided 
by EMS.

Battery acts as a grid-forming converter, not only balances the power 
differences, but also tends to stabilize the DC bus voltage through the 
bidirectional converter.

The EMS optimization model considers sampling time equal to 1h for 24h 
scheduling horizon. Thus, takes 24 discrete time indexes.
