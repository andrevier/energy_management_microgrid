## Check list for the project.

1. Why microgrids are important?
2. What are the advantages of the DC or AC microgrids?
3. Find a case to study the application of micrigrids.
4. Steps for starting simulation:
  - Choose the sources;
  - Loads;
  - and topology;
  - Possible services;
  - Simulate each source separately;
    - PV;
    - Batteries;
    - What are the best control options for each.
  - Simulate the grid with all the sources and loads together;
5. Implement the first two layers of control;
  - Supervisory control.
6. Energy management system;
  - Review the methods.
