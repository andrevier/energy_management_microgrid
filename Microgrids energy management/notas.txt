Os modelos para gerenciamento de energia buscam operação ótima da microrrede
em uma direção, por exemplo: 
- Redução do custo operacional.
- Load shedding: redução ou interrupção da energia em uma região específica 
para previnir a perda do sistema.

Métodos:
- Programação linear
- Programação Não-linear;
- Rule-based;

The main objectives of the energy management system are to optimize the 
operation, energy scheduling, and system reliability in both islanded and
grid-connected microgrids for sustainable development. Hence, microgrid
energy management system is a multi-objective topic that deals with 
technical, economical, and environmental issues.

The objective types of MG EMS depend on its operation mode, its centralized or
descentralized operation, economical aspects, and the intermittent and 
volatile nature of renewable energy sources.However, an extensive is still 
required to manage the customer privacy issues, secure and reliable communica
tion system cost management, particularly for decentralized operation.

Microgrid system reliability analysis is not studied in detail for islanding
and remote applications.
