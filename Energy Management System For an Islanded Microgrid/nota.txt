Research on islanded MG EMS.

Reviewed several works with mixed integer linear programming.
Main critics to this method is that they increase computations.

The reviewed works lack of solution for tidal turbine based islanded MG EMS, 
battery degradation cost consideration, and demand response computations at
each bus.

The solution: this paper aims at developing integer-free second-order cone 
programming based EMS (SOCP-EMS) model to minimize the operating and emission
costs of islanded MGs.

Case of study an isolated MG in Ouessant island.

Model and design of the equations for each source and their limitations.

Equation 20a establishes a non-convex NLP model.

Define if a constraint is linear, non-linear, convex or non-convex.

The solution implies relaxing non-convex constraints into convex ones. The 
authors site references on how to do it for some of the examples that can 
cause computational burden.

SOCP is prefered over semi-definite programming because of its lower 
computational complexity.

Proposed cases to study the effectiveness of the EMS model.

Cases to study emissions reduction.
