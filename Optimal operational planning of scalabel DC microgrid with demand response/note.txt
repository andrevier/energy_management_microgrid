What is the concept of plug-and-play microgrid?

Demand response (DR) is becoming an integral part of power system and MGs 
due to its applications in minimizing system operational cost, congestion 
management, peak demand management, defer investment in power network, 
system reliability, ancillary services. DR operation is achieved by utilizing
smart meters, advanced metering infrastructure, and energy information systems. 
An advanced metering infrastructure is used to collect data from metering 
devices using home area network. These data log are sent to service provider by
 wide area network for analysis in order to achieve energy cost and consumer 
service optimization.

DR is divided mainly into two types, price-based DR (PDR) and incentive-based
DR (IDR). PDR programs help the consumers to change their consumption pattern
with time-varying energy prices.

Debate on PDR and IDR over the world.

The proposed cost-operation model of a scalable grid-connected DC MG is 
a nonlinear programming model that also considers bus voltages and 
includes system losses in power balance constraint.

Integration of Li-ion battery into an MG system requires its degradation
cost-modeling for effective and efficient operation.

Increasing cell impedance and decreasing battery capacity due to unwanted side
reactions lead to fast degradation of battery [32,33]. Hence, the battery 
chemistry and its scheduling operation plays a major role in affecting battery
cyclelife. The most important parameters in battery degradation are **energy 
capacity** and **cyclelife**.

They depend on:
- temperature;
- depth of discharge (DOD);
- state of charge (SOC);
- charge and discharge rates (c-rates);
- battery application;
- type of battery;
- battery manufacturer.

Battery degradation modeling becomes unrealized as the effects of these 
degradation factors cannot be analyzed and modeled individually. Therefore,
 the most important degradation factors are considered to be temperature, DOD,
SOC, and c-rate.

Several studies have shown that SOC can also be defined in the form of a DOD.
A battery with DOD of d completes its charge-discharge cycle by discharging 
from 100% SOC to (100 )% âˆ’ d SOC and then charging back to 100% SOC.

LCOE is a widely used metric to determine the electricity generation cost of 
various energy technologies over the system lifespan.

The paragraph describes a proposed model involving a DC microgrid operator (DMO)
and incentive-based demand response (IDR) in the context of a microgrid system. 
In this model, consumers voluntarily grant control access to the DMO for their
shiftable load entities, which refers to electrical loads that can be shifted 
or rescheduled to different time periods. In return for granting control
 access, consumers receive incentives from the DMO.

The purpose of this model is to allow the DMO to adjust the shiftable loads to 
specific periods within the microgrid system. These periods include off-peak 
periods when electricity demand is relatively low, less generation supply
 periods when the generation capacity is limited, and scheduled islanding
 periods when the microgrid is operating in isolation from the main grid.

By managing the shiftable loads in this way, the DMO aims to optimize the 
overall operation of the microgrid while still adhering to system constraints. 
This approach can help improve the efficiency and reliability of the microgrid 
system by effectively utilizing available resources and minimizing strain on 
the system during periods of high demand or limited generation supply.

Shiftable loads: 
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), dishwasher, electric
water heater, electric vehicle, and lightning are few examples.

In the continuation of the paper, it is mentioned that various types of 
shiftable loads can be used in demand response (DR) within the context of the 
DC microgrid (DC MG) energy management model. Examples of such shiftable loads 
include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, dishwashers,
 electric water heaters, electric vehicles (EVs), and lighting.

However, incorporating all these different types of shiftable loads directly 
into the DC MG energy management model can lead to convergence issues and 
increased computational time. To address this challenge, the DMO takes a 
different approach. Instead of individually modeling and optimizing each 
shiftable load, the DMO aggregates the overall demand from the shiftable loads
 at each time interval (t).

By aggregating the demand from the shiftable loads, the DMO simplifies the 
problem and enables efficient resolution of the developed energy management 
model. This aggregation process allows the DMO to effectively manage the 
combined demand from multiple shiftable loads without getting into the 
complexities associated with modeling and optimizing each load separately.

The energy management model considers a grid-connected scalable DC MG 
consisting of a PV system, a Li-ion battery storage system, and shiftable and 
critical load demand.

In the continuation of the paper, it mentions the concept of "Time of Use" (TOU)
 energy prices for buying electricity. TOU pricing is a tariff structure in 
which the price of electricity varies based on the time of day. Under TOU 
pricing, different rates are applied during specific time periods, typically
 divided into peak, off-peak, and shoulder periods.

The TOU energy prices indicate that the cost of purchasing electricity is 
not constant throughout the day but rather varies depending on the time of use. This pricing structure is designed to incentivize consumers to shift their electricity consumption to off-peak or lower-demand periods, where electricity prices are typically lower.

By incorporating TOU energy prices, the paper suggests that the proposed model
 takes into account the varying cost of electricity throughout the day. This 
pricing information can be used as a factor in the decision-making process of 
the DMO when optimizing the scheduling and control of shiftable loads within 
the DC microgrid system. By considering TOU energy prices, the model can aim
 to reduce overall electricity costs by strategically shifting the usage of 
shiftable loads to times when electricity prices are lower.

The DC MG operator is a human-to-machine system that performs energy management operation with the help of local controllers
and a SCADA platform.

An optimization model was developed to minimize the operating cost of a DC 
microgrid, which includes:
- aging factors-dependent practical degradation cost model of a Li-ion battery;
- islanding-dependent demand response incentive to encourage active 
participation of customers during scheduled maintenance of grid-tie line.
- Levelized cost of photovoltaic system;
- System losses and nodal voltages;
